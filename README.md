# Shopping-Cart-Project
Project is inspired by "Jhon Smilga": https://github.com/john-smilga/setup-files-js-comfy-house
Here I am creating a shopping cart project with a interactive cart funtionality.
Always launch app with a server e.g. vs code live server. Because if you don't do so you will be not displayed the products.
